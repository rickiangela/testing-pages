    <h1>Ricki's Favorite Animal</h1>

    <h3>Dogs!</h3>

    <p>I do like many animals to varying degrees, but my favorite animal is a dog. I have had dogs my entire life. They are the most connected to me, and for that reason they are my favorite.</p>
    <p>I grew up with one dog names Harley. He was very much MY dog. He is where my love of dogs begin. When I was a teenager we rescued a dog named Rocki, and she is the most perfect dog in the world. Any person who hates dogs loves Rocki because she is so great. I still have Rocki, but I also have another dog named Apollo. He is bad, but he is cute> I like the turd boy.</p>
